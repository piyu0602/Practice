Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

ANS: 
vector<int> gradingStudents(vector<int> grades) {
    int mul =0;
    for(int i=0;i<grades.size();i++)
    {
        mul =((grades[i]/5)+1)*5; 
        if(grades[i] < 38)
        {
           grades[i] = grades[i]; 
        }
        else if((mul - grades[i]) < 3)
        {
            grades[i] = mul;
        }
        else 
        {
            grades[i] = grades[i];
        }
        
    }
    return grades;
