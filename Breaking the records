Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for
most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

ANS: 
vector<int> breakingRecords(vector<int> scores) {
    int min = scores[0];
    int cnt1 =0;
    int max = 0;
    int cnt2=0;
    
    vector<int> res;
    for(int i=0;i<scores.size();i++)
    {
        if(max<scores[i])
        {
            max = scores[i];
            cnt1 ++;    
        }
    }
    for(int i=1;i<scores.size();i++)
    {
        if(min>scores[i])
        {
            min = scores[i];
            cnt2++;
        }
    }
    
    res.push_back(cnt1-1);
    res.push_back(cnt2);
