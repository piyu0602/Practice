You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.




ANS:
string kangaroo(int x1, int v1, int x2, int v2) {
    int  a  = x1+v1;
    int b = x2 +v2;
    
    if(v1 > v2)
    {
        if(b%a ==0 || a==b)
        {
            return "YES";
        }
        else if((x2-x1)%(v2-v1) == 0  || (x1-x2)%(v1-v2) == 0 ) 
        {
            return "YES";
        }
        else
        {
            return "NO";
        }
