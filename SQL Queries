Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

ANS: SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A+B <= C or A+C <= B or B+C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A=B  and  B=C THEN 'Equilateral' 
        WHEN A=B or A=C or B=C THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN A<>B and B<>C THEN 'Scalene'
   END tuple
FROM TRIANGLES;
